## Project Summary

This project is a Next.js frontend assessment. Here is what was implemented:

- Set up a Next.js app with custom configuration and optimized font loading.
- Created reusable icon components for Interaction, Pen, React, and Vue icons in `src/app/icons/`.
- Added SVG assets for various UI elements in `public/interaction/`, `public/pen/`, `public/reactIcon/`, and `public/Vue/`.
- Built a `StatCard` component in `src/cards/StatCard.jsx` for displaying statistics.
- Developed `Stats` and `Text` components in `src/components/` for UI and data presentation.
- Customized global styles in `src/app/globals.css`.
- Provided a main layout and page structure in `src/app/layout.js` and `src/app/page.js`.
- Wrote documentation and setup instructions in this README.


### Main Files and Folders

- **src/app/page.js**: Renders the homepage layout using custom `Text` and `Stats` components, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **src/app/layout.js**: Sets up the root layout, imports/configures Google fonts, applies global styles, and wraps all pages in a consistent HTML structure.
- **src/app/icons/**: Contains reusable React components for various icons (Interaction, Pen, React, Vue) used throughout the UI.
- **src/cards/StatCard.jsx**: Implements a card component for displaying individual statistics.
- **src/components/Stats.jsx & src/components/Text.jsx**: `Stats.jsx` displays statistical data, likely using `StatCard`. `Text.jsx` handles text content or headings for the UI.
- **public/interaction/**, **public/pen/**, **public/reactIcon/**, **public/Vue/**: Stores SVG assets for icons and UI graphics, organized by category.
- **src/app/globals.css**: Contains global CSS styles for the entire app.

Assessment task 3
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
